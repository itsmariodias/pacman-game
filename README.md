# pacman-game
A simple OpenGL Pacman game

A simple implementation of the Pacman game in OpenGL.
Done as an assignment for my Computer Graphics class.

Move Pacman with the arrow keys, and collect all the orbs. Each orb collected adds to the score. Pacman will move in the same direction unless changed. If he encounters a wall he will stop.

Programmed and executed in Eclipse C++ IDE. Using freeglut as the OpenGL GLUT library. Made in April 2020.

To run (For Eclipse C++ IDE with freeglut only):
```
Build pacman.c
In Binaries Right click the exe file and Run As Local C++ Application
```

Alternatively:
```
Move regions.txt in Debug folder
Execute the PacmanProject.exe
```
